# Dotfiles for macOS

> Zsh, neovim, tbd...

## Installation

**WARNING:** I highly recommend to use this dotfiles as inspiration only, and to not install them directly.

Having said that, installing this dotfiles is quite simple. I use [dotbot](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot/) for keeping track of what links to what, and i recommend you go through their documentation if you find some problems during the installation.

Installing this dotfiles should be as straightforward as

```
git clone https://github.com/vikepic/dotfiles
cd dotfiles
./install
```

Hope you have fun with them :)
